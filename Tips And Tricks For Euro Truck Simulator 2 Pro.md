Control Tuning

Set your triggers to acceleration and braking for a more intuitive driving experience.
Set your right stick to look, and increase your up/down look deadzone to quickly scan intersections without accidentally looking at the floor or roof of your cab.
Increase your steering sensitivity to improve cornering at speed.
Efficiency

Use cruise control to maintain a consistent speed and avoid speeding violations.
Set your cruise tolerance to zero and turn on auto retarder to travel up to 9 kph over the posted speed limit without getting cited.
Watch out for speed limit signs, especially in areas with speed cameras.
Manage your sleep efficiently by resting only when necessary, as each rest period burns 9 hours.
Take advantage of EZPass lanes at toll plazas to save time.
Your Rig

Invest in a Volvo or other trucks with good baseline HP to improve performance.
Prioritize engine and transmission upgrades, including retarder for cruise control.
Consider adding a light bar with aux lights, but note that they only work with high beams.
Side skirts and a bull bar can help reduce damage from accidents.
Miscellaneous

Avoid traveling empty or "bobtail" by taking short distance jobs to nearby cities.
Focus on $ per km when selecting jobs, and remember that payout includes skill bonuses.
Fuel up before crossing the channel to avoid higher prices in the UK.
